React Roadmap 2025

### 1. Web Development Fundamentals

1.1 Learn HTML5 (semantic tags, accessibility)

1.2 Learn CSS (Flexbox, Grid, responsive design)

1.3 Master modern JavaScript (ES6+ features like `let`, `const`, arrow functions, destructuring, modules)

1.4 DOM manipulation basics

1.5 Fetch API, Promises, `async/await`

---

### 2. React Basics

2.1 Set up project with Create React App or Vite

2.2 Understand JSX syntax

2.3 Build functional components

2.4 Use `props` to pass data

2.5 Manage state with `useState`

2.6 Handle events (`onClick`, `onChange`, etc.)

2.7 Style components (inline, CSS modules, classNames)

---

### 3. Intermediate React

3.1 Component hierarchy and composition

3.2 Conditional rendering (`if`, ternary, logical &&)

3.3 Rendering lists with `.map()` and `key` props

3.4 Controlled vs uncontrolled components in forms

3.5 Lifting state up

3.6 Using `useEffect` for side effects

3.7 Implementing routing with `react-router-dom`

---

### 4. Advanced React

4.1 Sharing state with Context API

4.2 Using `useRef` for DOM and mutable values

4.3 Creating custom hooks

4.4 Error boundaries

4.5 Lazy loading with `React.lazy` and `Suspense`

4.6 Performance optimization: `React.memo`, `useMemo`, `useCallback`

---

### 5. State Management Libraries

5.1 Redux Toolkit (recommended over classic Redux)

5.2 Zustand (lightweight alternative)

5.3 Other options: Recoil, MobX, Jotai

---

### 6. TypeScript with React

6.1 Setting up TypeScript in React

6.2 Typing props and component state

6.3 Typing hooks and contexts

6.4 Using TypeScript generics in components and hooks

---

### 7. Testing in React

7.1 Unit testing with Jest

7.2 Component testing with React Testing Library

7.3 Integration testing

7.4 E2E testing with Cypress or Playwright

---

### 8. Fullstack & SSR (Next.js)

8.1 Understand pages and routing in Next.js

8.2 Server-side rendering (`getServerSideProps`)

8.3 Static generation (`getStaticProps`)

8.4 API routes and backend logic

8.5 Middleware and authentication with NextAuth

---

### 9. Deployment & DevOps

9.1 Deploy to Vercel, Netlify, or Firebase

9.2 Configure CI/CD with GitHub Actions

9.3 Monitor performance and errors with Sentry, LogRocket

9.4 Optimize bundle size and use Lighthouse

---

### 10. Best Practices & Patterns

10.1 Component reuse and abstraction

10.2 Scalable folder structure

10.3 Accessibility (a11y) standards

10.4 Responsive and mobile-first design

10.5 ESLint, Prettier, Husky for code quality

10.6 Security (XSS, CSRF) basics in React apps
